This is my submission for CSCE 3550 project 3. Rather than including a test client, I have opted to implement the optional rate limiter for the POST:/auth endpoint. The included screenshot shows full coverage of the gradebot test client. However, during one test, the requests came in slower than 10 per second and all returned code 200. I have not been able to replicate this as they have since come in quick enough to set off the rate limiter like in the screenshot, but I thought I would make it known just in case. If this does happen please rerun the gradebot program and it should produce full marks.
